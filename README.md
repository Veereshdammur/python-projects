## Kd_Tree

A Kd-tree, or K-dimensional tree, is a generalization of a binary search tree that stores points in a k-dimensional space. In computer science it is often used for organizing some number of points in a space with k dimensions. Kd-trees are very useful for range and nearest neighbor (NN) searches, it is a very common operation in computer vision, computational geometry, data mining, machine learning.

The current project contains functions for building 2- and 3-dimensional Kd trees out of given point sets in 2- and 3-dimensional Cartesian space. 

* Kd_Tree.py -- 2-dimensional Kd tree
* Kd_Tree_3D.py -- 3-dimensional Kd tree

More details about building Kd trees ans using them for Nearest Neighbor (NN) search you can find folloiwing the link:

## dense_disparity_segments

This project was a part of my PhD in GÃ¶ttingen. The goal is to incorporate linked stereo segments for estimation of disparity for weakly textured objects.
